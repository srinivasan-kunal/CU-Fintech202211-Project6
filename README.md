# Housing Price and Rental Analysis of San Fransisco Housing
---
In this project, we use data visualization skills, including aggregation, interactive visualizations, and geospatial analysis, to evaluate properties in the San Francisco market and identify viable investment opportunities.

## Technologies

Key python libraries required for the program have been imported in the first code block and includes- `pandas`, `pathlib` and 
`hvplot` and `geoviews`.

Follow the installation guide to install the visualization libraries from PyViz and us the code below to confirm if the hvplot & geoviews are already installed

```python
 conda list hvplot
    
 conda list geoviews
```

## Installation Guide

In case hvplot & geoviews libraries are unavailable the following commands in the terminal will help install them through pyviz.

```python
conda install -c pyviz hvplot geoviews
```
